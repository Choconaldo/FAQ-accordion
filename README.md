## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla JavasSript

### What I learned

I've learned a little more about accessibility by using semantic HTML and its intrinsic attributes, like using button tags to make keyboard only navigation possible.

I also learned how to make my code dryer using loops to add event listeners.
